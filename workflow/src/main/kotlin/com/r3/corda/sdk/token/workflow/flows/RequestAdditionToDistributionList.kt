/**
 * Simple set of flows for a party to request updates for a particular evolvable token. These flows don't do much
 * checking, the responder always adds a requesting party to the distribution list.
 *
 * As this flow requires a [StateAndRef] in the constructor, it is only intended to be called by parties that have _at
 * least_ one version of the evolvable token. This is probably acceptable as when the issuer issues some of the token
 * for the first time to a party, then they will also send along the most current version of the evolvable token as
 * well. This also simplifies the workflow a bit; when tokens are issued, it is expected that the issuer sends along the
 * evolvable token as well and likewise when some amount of token is transferred from one party to another. Once a party
 * has at least one version of the evolvable token, they can request to be automatically updated using this flow going
 * forward.
 *
 * When data distribution groups are available then these flows can be retired. However, they are sufficient for the
 * time being.
