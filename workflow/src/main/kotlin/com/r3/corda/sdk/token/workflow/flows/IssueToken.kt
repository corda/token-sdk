/**
 * This flow takes a bunch of parameters and is used to issue a token or an amount of some token on the ledger to
 * a specified party. Most of the parameters are self explanatory. Most likely, this flow will be used as a sub-flow
 * from another flow which handles the over-arching token issuance process.
 *
 * @param owner the party which is the recipient of the token or amount of tokens
 * @param notary the notary which will be used for the owned token state. Currently the same notary must be used for the
 * token and the owned token if it contains an evolvable pointer.
 * @param token the type of token which will be issued. This can either be a [FixedToken] or a [TokenPointer]. Both
 * types are [EmbeddableToken]s as specified by the type parameter [T]. Fixed tokens are token definitions which can be
 * inlined into an owned token state. They are the most straight-forward token type to use. [FixedToken]s are mainly
 * used for things like [Money] which rarely change, if at all. For other types of token which have properties that are
 * expected to change over time, we use the [TokenPointer]. The [TokenPointer] points to an [EvolvableToken] which is
 * a [LinearState] that contains the details of the token. The token which is provided is not wrapped with an [IssuedTokenType]
 * object, instead, the issuer becomes the party which invokes this flow. This makes sense because it is impossible to
 * have an issuer other than the node which invokes the [IssueToken.Initiator] flow.
 * @param amount the amount of the token to be issued. Note that this can be set to null. If it is set to null then an
 * [OwnedToken] state is issued. This state wraps a [IssuedTokenType] [EmbeddableToken] with an [owner]. The [EmbeddableToken] is
 * non-fungible inside [OwnedToken]s - they cannot be split or merged because there is only ever one of them. However,
 * if an amount is specified, then that many tokens will be issued using an [FungibleToken] state. Currently, there
 * will be a single [FungibleToken] state issued for the amount of [IssuedTokenType] [EmbeddableToken] specified. Note that
 * if an amount of ONE is specified and the token has fraction digits set to "0.1" then that ONE token could be split
 * into TEN atomic units of the token. Likewise, if the token has fraction digits set to "0.01", then that ONE token
 * could be split into ONE HUNDRED atomic units of the token.
 * @param anonymous defaults to true. When true, the issuer asks the recipient for a newly generated public key which
 * will be used as the owning key for the tokens.
 *
 * It is likely that this flow will be split up in the future as the process becomes more complex.
 *
 * TODO: Add more constructors.
 * TODO: Allow for more customisation, e.g. tokens issued across multiple states instead of a single FungibleToken.
 * TODO: Split into two flows. One for owned tokens and another for owned token amounts.
 * TODO: Profile and optimise this flow.
