/**
 * Represents a token type or definition which can be embedded within an [NonFungibleToken] or [FungibleToken] state.
 * This interface is implemented by [TokenPointer] and custom token types. Note that [EvolvableTokenType] does NOT
 * implement this interface, as it is represented by proxy through the [TokenPointer].
 *
 * Just a quick level-set on terminology here. [TokenType] refers to a "type of thing" as opposed to the vehicle
 * which is used to represent the agreement between an issuer and the holder of tokens. For that we use the
 * [NonFungibleToken] state for representing the agreement between an issuer and a holder of a token which cannot be
 * split and merged, and the [FungibleToken] state for representing the agreement between an issuer and a holder of some
 * amount of a token which can be split and merged.
 *
 * [TokenType]s can be inlined into the [NonFungibleToken] or [FungibleToken] class. Implement [TokenType] when you don't
 * expect tokens to evolve.
