 * obtain the data within the [EvolvableTokenType]. This way, the token token type can evolve independently from the
 * question of which [Party] owns some issued amount of it, as the data is held in a separate state object.
 *
 * @property pointer a [LinearPointer] which points to an [EvolvableTokenType].
