/**
 * This is the [FungibleToken] contract. It is likely to be present in MANY transactions. The [FungibleToken]
 * state is a "lowest common denominator" state in that its contract does not reference any other state types, only the
 * [FungibleToken]. However, the [FungibleToken] state can and will be referenced by many other contracts, for
 * example, the obligation contract.
 *
 * The [FungibleToken] contract sub-classes the [AbstractToken] contract which contains the "verify" method.
 * To add functionality to this contract, developers should:
 * 1. Create their own commands which implement the [TokenCommand] interface.
 * 2. Override the [AbstractTokenContract.dispatchOnCommand] method to add support for the new command, remembering
 *    to call the super method to handle the existing commands.
 * 3. Add a method to handle the new command in the new sub-class contract.
